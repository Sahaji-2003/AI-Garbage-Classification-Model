# Garbage Classification AI Model

This repository contains an AI garbage classification model built using a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model takes an image of garbage, scans it, and predicts the type of waste among four categories: recyclable, e-waste, organic waste, and biomedical waste.
