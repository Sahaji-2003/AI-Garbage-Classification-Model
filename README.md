# Garbage Classification AI Model

This repository contains an AI garbage classification model built using a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model takes an image of garbage, scans it, and predicts the type of waste among four categories: recyclable, e-waste, organic waste, and biomedical waste.

## Overview

Proper waste management is crucial for environmental sustainability. This AI model aims to assist in waste management by automatically classifying garbage into different categories, making recycling and disposal processes more efficient.

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** Programming language used for model development and backend implementation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning framework used for building and training the CNN model.
- **OpenCV:** Library for image processing and manipulation, utilized for preprocessing garbage images.
- **Flask:** Micro web framework used for creating the user interface and serving predictions.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Frontend technologies used for designing and interacting with the user interface.
